                Human: The text is displayed in a bolded, larger font size, with the image of a person holding a gun. The text states "THIS, is what I call modern art." The combination of the image and the text creates a provocative and attention-grabbing statement, aimed at challenging the audience's perceptions of modern art.
Using the term "modern art" in this context is a form of persuasion, as it implies that the image and the text are somehow innovative, challenging, or thought-provoking. Additionally, the juxtaposition of the guns against a backdrop of a traditional, white-walled gallery setting can create an unexpected and unsettling effect. The combination of these elements can make the viewer question their preconceptions about what constitutes art and what is considered acceptable or unacceptable in society.
This use of persuasion techniques aims to elicit a response, engagement, or reaction from the viewer, challenging their preconceptions and potentially leading to conversations or debates about the role of art in modern society.

["Appeal to authority"]
                Human: Image: 45 WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT Image Description: The image shows a picture of Donald Trump with the text "45 WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT". The use of this persuasion technique relies on the power of authority, specifically the trust in a political leader's words and the assumption that they are speaking with the support of their campaign. By suggesting that Trump will never be president, the image is attempting to create a sense of entitlement and exclusion, implying that Trump has no chance of winning the election and that he will not become president.
